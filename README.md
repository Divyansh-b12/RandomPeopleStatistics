The goal of this test is to create an python API client for the following user api: https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/users

- Create an API client to call the api 10 times.
- Use your client to return statistics on the stored objects. Give the average age of the 10 users (use the date_of_birth property to determine age). 
- Return the top 5 oldest and the top 5 youngest.
- (Bonus) Add an option to your client to use a caching system instead of calling the API directly.
- (Bonus) Add unit tests to your client.

Please use the `typing` module for variables, function and method definitions.
